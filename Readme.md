Neighbourhood Map Project

Introduction:
In this project I have selected some of my favorite places and marked it on google maps using google maps API. In this project we have to use different google maps API's, make markers which will point on the locations we give and get some information about the place.

To Run:
1. All the javascript, css and html files must be downloaded in your computer.
2. After you have downloaded the files just open the project.html with google chrome or with any other browser which you use.
3. You can search places from the list of locations which can be seen below the search button.

Resources:
1. Understood the logic and thought process of implimenting foursquare api using '.getJSON' from https://github.com/lastres0rt/udacity-neighborhood-map-project/blob/master/js/app.js
2. Learnt the knockout js from the documentation page of Knockout JS and Udacity's Full-stack Web Development nanondegree.
